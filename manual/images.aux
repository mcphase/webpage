In the case when $m>0$\ and both parameters $B_l^m$\ and $B_l^{-m}$\ are nonzero, one of these $B_l^m$\ with $m>0$ can by made zero by a rotation of the coordinate system. However, the appropriate orientation of the coordinate system in these cases is not known {\em  a priori}. It requires the knowledge of the CEF parameters. Note, that for cubic symmetry additionally B$_4^4$=5 B$_4^0$, B$_6^4$=-21 B$_6^0$.
