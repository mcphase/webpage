To the discreet Reader</A>
</H2>

<P>
400 years ago it was in the peaceful lagoon of Venice, where Galileo Galilei found bamboo
 and the first man to fabricate transparent glass so he could build a telescope.  
His telescope soon provided evidence for new models of the solar system in contrast
to the AI, the Aristotelian Intelligence. In his words "In questions of science, 
the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual."

<P>
Today it is in the peaceful lagoon of Venice, where at the beginning of the year gathers a small
group of scientists. Circumvented by the floating water of the lagoon they
 build a new kind of simulation suite for models of the solid state.
The concept is in contrast to the wide spread focus on purely electronic properties
promoted by many cardinals of science. 

<P>
In this manual, frequently there appear three characters in conversations. The 
first one is Orlando , who is appassionate about creating high magnetic fields.
He is of hot temperament and loves basic science which can be applied to 
technical devices. Orlando does not like complicated formulas but is willing
to collaborate with theoreticians to get a better understanding of material properties.
The second character is Ewald - he is, in contrast to Orlando in love with
formulas and mathematical treatises. He is extremely accurate and 
if we let him alone write this book, we will
end up with a large pile of paper and it will be hard to find out where to
look up what. The third person the reader will meet is Simplicius , 
 he is  simple minded and a
strong personality who will not tolerate any other opinion. He tries to
control the direction of activities such as to promote his interest. His 
interest is mainly that of controlling the activities by evaluating the work
which is done by others. 

<P>
By means of their lively discussions we hope to immerse
 the appreciated reader into the lagoon of ideas which penetrates
 the models of solid matter.
